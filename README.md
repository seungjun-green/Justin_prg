This is a twitter bot that acts like a human Software Engineer.
It tweets about 3 following things: dev talk, joke, and news.

Work on pycharm, then commit, push to Github


Open GCP terminal, and pull to update the code to recent one. Then run the code. If error happens, record it to twwt_errors.json or openai_errors.json then commit/push to github


Currently, I'm getting emial notification for push.(it could be either from Pycharm-updating code, or gcp-updating error log file)
